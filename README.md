## Dataset Description

The dataset contains transactional and categorical sales information for Retails Mart. Each record represents a sales transaction, including details such as product type, customer segment, quantity, and revenue.

Key Features Include:

* Order ID – Unique transaction identifier
* Product Category – Category or sub-category of items sold
* Customer Segment – Customer classification (Corporate, Consumer, etc.)
* Region – Geographic region of the transaction
* Quantity Sold – Number of units sold
* Sales Amount – Total sales revenue
* Discount – Discount applied to each order
* Profit – Profit earned per transaction
* Order Date – Date of purchase, used for time-based trend analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process focused on identifying business drivers and operational challenges through:

* Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and data-type inconsistencies.
* Univariate Analysis: Examined distributions of sales, discounts, and profits.
* Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis: Explored relationships between product categories, customer segments, and sales performance.
* Time-Series Trends: Analyzed monthly and quarterly sales trends to identify peak seasons.
* Profitability Analysis: Identified categories and regions contributing most to profit or loss.

Visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps were used to uncover hidden trends and relationships.

## Key Insights

* Top Products: A few product categories generated a majority of total sales and profit, indicating potential for focused marketing or stock prioritization.
* Regional Performance: Certain regions consistently outperformed others, revealing opportunities for regional sales expansion.
* Customer Segments: Corporate and Consumer segments drove most of the revenue, while others contributed less to profit.
* Seasonality: Peak sales were observed during specific months or quarters, suggesting potential for targeted promotions during low seasons.
* Discount Impact: Excessive discounts negatively impacted profit margins, highlighting the need for better discount control strategies.

## Recommendations

1. Prioritize High-Profit Categories:
   Focus inventory and marketing budgets on products with the highest profit margins.

2. Regional Optimization:
   Increase investment in top-performing regions while developing targeted campaigns for low-performing areas.

3. Customer Retention Programs:
   Design loyalty programs for repeat customers, especially in high-value segments.

4. Discount Strategy Review:
   Evaluate discount structures to balance customer incentives with profit sustainability.

5. Inventory & Demand Planning:
 Use sales trends to optimize restocking schedules and avoid overstocking during off-peak periods.

## Future Work

* Build predictive models to forecast future sales and profit trends.
* Develop interactive dashboards using Power BI or Tableau for real-time decision-making.
* Incorporate customer feedback and external economic data for a more holistic performance view.
